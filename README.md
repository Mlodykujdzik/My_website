# My First Website

This is my very first website, hosted on my personal server. 
It showcases my various projects, ranging from simple HTML/CSS pages to more advanced electronic projects like DIY Ambilight for TVs. I also include school assignments and other learning experiments here, primarily created for my dad and myself to explore new things.
